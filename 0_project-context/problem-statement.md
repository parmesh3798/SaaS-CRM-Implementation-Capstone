# Problem Statement

## Client Context
The client is a mid-size B2B SaaS company (~100 employees) selling subscription-based software to other businesses.
The company has separate Sales and Support teams and is experiencing rapid growth.

## Current Situation
The organization currently lacks a centralized and reliable CRM system.
Customer and lead data is scattered across spreadsheets, inboxes, and individual tools, leading to operational inefficiencies.

## Key Problems Identified

### 1. Lead Management Breakdown
Leads from marketing campaigns and inbound channels are not consistently tracked or followed up.
Sales representatives manually manage leads, resulting in missed opportunities and poor conversion visibility.

### 2. Support SLA Misses
Customer support requests arrive through multiple channels with no standardized case tracking.
There is limited visibility into response times, ownership, and SLA compliance.

### 3. Lack of Executive Visibility
Leadership does not have real-time insight into:
- Sales pipeline health
- Lead conversion rates
- Support workload and SLA performance

Decisions are often made based on assumptions rather than data.

## Business Impact
If left unresolved, these issues will:
- Reduce revenue due to lost or delayed sales follow-ups
- Decrease customer satisfaction because of inconsistent support
- Limit leadership’s ability to scale operations confidently

## Why a CRM Implementation Is Required
A structured CRM system is required to:
- Centralize customer and lead data
- Standardize sales and support workflows
- Provide real-time reporting for operational and executive teams
- Enable scalable growth without increasing manual effort
